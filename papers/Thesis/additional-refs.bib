  abstract = {Impulsivity is considered a personality trait affecting behavior in many life domains, from recreational activities to important decision making. When extreme, it is associated with mental health problems, such as substance use disorders, as well as with interpersonal and social difficulties, including juvenile delinquency and criminality. Yet, trait impulsivity may not be a unitary construct. We review commonly used self-report measures of personality trait impulsivity and related constructs (e.g., sensation seeking), plus the opposite pole, control or constraint. A meta-analytic principal-components factor analysis demonstrated that these scales comprise 3 distinct factors, each of which aligns with a broad, higher order personality factor\textemdash{}Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality, Disinhibition versus Constraint/Conscientiousness, and Extraversion/Positive Emotionality/Sensation Seeking. Moreover, Disinhibition versus Constraint/Conscientiousness comprise 2 correlated but distinct subfactors: Disinhibition versus Constraint and Conscientiousness/Will versus Resourcelessness. We also review laboratory tasks that purport to measure a construct similar to trait impulsivity. A meta-analytic principal-components factor analysis demonstrated that these tasks constitute 4 factors (Inattention, Inhibition, Impulsive Decision-Making, and Shifting). Although relations between these 2 measurement models are consistently low to very low, relations between both trait scales and laboratory behavioral tasks and daily-life impulsive behaviors are moderate. That is, both independently predict problematic daily-life impulsive behaviors, such as substance use, gambling, and delinquency; their joint use has incremental predictive power over the use of either type of measure alone and furthers our understanding of these important, problematic behaviors. Future use of confirmatory methods should help to ascertain with greater precision the number of and relations between impulsivity-related components.},

Of critical importance for clinical psychological science, EF impairments are associated with most forms of psychopathology. However, despite the proliferation of research on EF in clinical populations, with notable exceptions clinical and cognitive approaches to EF have remained largely independent, leading to failures to apply theoretical and methodological advances in one field to the other field and hindering progress. First, we review the current state of knowledge of EF impairments associated with psychopathology and limitations to the previous research in light of recent advances in understanding and measuring EF. Next, we offer concrete suggestions for improving EF assessment. Last, we suggest future directions, including integrating modern models of EF with state of the art, hierarchical models of dimensional psychopathology as well as translational implications of EF-informed research on clinical science.},

  abstract = {In modern individual-difference studies, researchers often correlate performance on various tasks to uncover common latent processes. Yet, in some sense, the results have been disappointing as correlations among tasks that seemingly have processes in common are often low. A pressing question then is whether these attenuated correlations reflect statistical considerations, such as a lack of individual variability on tasks, or substantive considerations, such as that inhibition in different tasks is not a unified concept. One problem in addressing this question is that researchers aggregate performance across trials to tally individual-by-task scores. It is tempting to think that aggregation is fine and that everything comes out in the wash. But as shown here, this aggregation may greatly attenuate measures of effect size and correlation. We propose an alternative analysis of task performance that is based on accounting for trial-by-trial variability along with the covariation of individuals' performance across tasks. The implementation is through common hierarchical models, and this treatment rescues classical concepts of effect size, reliability, and correlation for studying individual differences with experimental tasks. Using recent data from Hedge et al. Behavioral Research Methods, 50(3), 1166\textendash{}1186, 2018 we show that there is Bayes-factor support for a lack of correlation between the Stroop and flanker task. This support for a lack of correlation indicates a psychologically relevant result\textemdash{}Stroop and flanker inhibition are seemingly unrelated, contradicting unified concepts of inhibition.},

  abstract = {Establishing correlations among common inhibition tasks such as Stroop or flanker tasks has been proven quite difficult despite many attempts. It remains unknown whether this difficulty occurs because inhibition is a disparate set of phenomena or whether the analytic techniques to uncover a unified inhibition phenomenon fail in real-world contexts. In this paper, we explore the field-wide inability to assess whether inhibition is unified or disparate. We do so by showing that ordinary methods of correlating performance including those with latent variable models are doomed to fail because of trial noise (or, as it is sometimes called, measurement error). We then develop hierarchical models that account for variation across trials, variation across individuals, and covariation across individuals and tasks. These hierarchical models also fail to uncover correlations in typical designs for the same reasons. While we can characterize the degree of trial noise, we cannot recover correlations in typical designs that enroll hundreds of people. We discuss possible improvements to study designs to help uncovering correlations, though we are not sure how feasible they are.},

In most tasks, like Stroop or priming, the tobe-ignored distractors affect the response to be more like the distractors. We call this assimilation. Yet, in some tasks, the opposite holds. Constrast occurs when the response is caused to be least like the distractors. Contrast and assimilation are opposing behavioral effects, but they both occur when to-be-ignored information affects judgments. We ask here whether inhibition across contrastive and assimilative tasks is common or distinct. Assimilation and contrast are often thought to have different underlying psychological mechanisms, and we use a correlational analysis with hierarchical Bayesian models as a test of this hypothesis. We designed tasks with large assimilation or contrast effects. The stimuli are morphed letters, and whether there is contrast or assimilation depends on whether the surrounding information is a letter field (contrast) or a word field (assimilation). Critically, a positive correlation was found\textemdash{}individuals who better inhibited contrast-inducing contexts also better inhibited assimilation-inducing contexts. These results indicate that inhibition is common, at least in part, across contrast and assimilation tasks.},

In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum efficiency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either H1 or H0, and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

  abstract = {Indices of human performance are less clear-cut than analogous measures in the physical sciences for several reasons. Variables which can alter performance include the noise upon which sensory signals are imposed, the bias shown by an observer towards one or another alternative, the use of an optional-stopping strategy for examining sensory input, and the accumulation of statistical information over time concerning the source of the input. The development of a theoretical appreciation of these variables is traced and, on this basis, a measure of the noise, which sets a limit to discriminative capacity, is suggested. The proposed index is simply the standard deviation of the best fitting normal ogive, calculated for the psychometric function obtained in a forced-choice discrimination task by the method of constant stimuli, the discriminanda being presented for 100 ms, in random order, and followed by appropriate backward masking. The index is thus closely related to traditional psychophysical measures, but is distinguished by the detailed specification of conditions under which it should be obtained. Analysis of data from previous experiments gives some indication of the order of magnitude that might be expected from a carefully controlled determination of the measure. In addition, three experiments were carried out to evaluate this suggestion, and to test its underlying rationale. In the first two, observers were required to discriminate, by pressing one of two keys, between two lines of markedly different length, exposed in random order for ten different durations. In the third, stimulus exposure was held constant, while ten different stimulus differences were presented in random order. Results from the first two experiments yielded estimates of minimum inspection time close to 100 ms, and were inconsistent with the view that observers can abandon an optional-stopping procedure of processing sensory information in favour of responding by a deadline. Measures of noise calculated in the third experiment were of the order expected on the proposed rationale, while response latencies were again inconsistent with the notion of deadline responding. Further analysis of the results of the three experiments suggests that measures of inspection time and noise, together with a third index related to the degree of caution exercised by an observer, appear to be stable and consistent descriptors of performance. The wider implications of the successful use of this kind of perceptual index of performance are discussed with reference to the measurement of visual acuity, as a means for detecting effects of environmental stress, and as a conceptual framework for the understanding of individual differences.},

  abstract = {Some people are better readers than others, and this variation in comprehension ability is predicted by measures of working memory capacity (WMC). The primary goal of this study was to investigate the mediating role of mind-wandering experiences in the association between WMC and normal individual differences in reading comprehension, as predicted by the executive-attention theory of WMC (e.g., Engle \& Kane, 2004). We used a latent-variable, structural-equation-model approach, testing skilled adult readers on 3 WMC span tasks, 7 varied reading-comprehension tasks, and 3 attention-control tasks. Mind wandering was assessed using experimenter-scheduled thought probes during 4 different tasks (2 reading, 2 attention-control). The results support the executive-attention theory of WMC. Mind wandering across the 4 tasks loaded onto a single latent factor, reflecting a stable individual difference. Most important, mind wandering was a significant mediator in the relationship between WMC and reading comprehension, suggesting that the WMC\textendash{} comprehension correlation is driven, in part, by attention control over intruding thoughts. We discuss implications for theories of WMC, attention control, and reading comprehension.},

  abstract = {Several theories have been put forth to explain the relation between working memory (WM) and gF. Unfortunately, no single factor has been shown to fully account for the relation between these two important constructs. In the current study we tested whether multiple factors (capacity, attention control, and secondary memory) would collectively account for the relation. A large number of participants performed multiple measures of each construct and latent variable analyses were used to examine the data. The results demonstrated that capacity, attention control, and secondary memory were uniquely related to WM storage, WM processing, and gF. Importantly, the three factors completely accounted for the relation between WM (both processing and storage) and gF. Thus, although storage and processing make independent contributions to gF, both of these contributions are accounted for by variation in capacity, attention control and secondary memory. These results are consistent with the multifaceted view of WM, suggesting that individual differences in capacity, attention control, and secondary memory jointly account for individual differences in WM and its relation with gF.},

This working memory limitation can be conceived of as arising from 2 components: a dynamic attention component (primary memory) and a probabilistic cue-dependent search component (secondary memory). This framework is used to examine previous individual differences studies of working memory capacity, and new evidence is examined on the basis of predictions of the framework to performance on immediate free recall. It is suggested that individual differences in working memory capacity are partially due to the ability to maintain information accessible in primary memory and the ability to search for information from secondary memory.},

In these paradigms, randomly selected participants are asked to study randomly selected items. In practice, researchers aggregate data across items or participants or both. The signal detection model is nonlinear; consequently, analysis with aggregated data is not consistent. In fact, mnemonic ability is underestimated, even in the large-sample limit. We present two hierarchical Bayesian models that simultaneously account for participant and item variability. We show how these models provide for accurate estimation of participants' mnemonic ability as well as the memorability of items. The model is benchmarked with a simulation study and applied to a novel data set.},

While dedicated software for laboratory-based experimentation and online surveys is commonplace, researchers looking to implement experiments in the browser have, heretofore, often had to manually construct their studies' content and logic using code. We introduce lab.js, a free, open-source experiment builder that makes it easy to build studies for both online and in-laboratory data collection. Through its visual interface, stimuli can be designed and combined into a study without programming, though studies' appearance and behavior can be fully customized using html, css and JavaScript code if required. Presentation and response times are kept and measured with high accuracy and precision heretofore unmatched in browser-based studies. Experiments constructed with lab.js can be run directly on a local computer and published online with ease, with direct deployment to cloud hosting, export to web servers, and integration with popular data collection platforms. Studies can also be shared in an editable format, archived, re-used and adapted, enabling effortless, transparent replications, and thus facilitating open, cumulative science. The software is provided free of charge under an open-source license; further information, code and extensive documentation are available from https://lab.js.org.},

  abstract = {A prevailing notion in experimental psychology is that individuals' performance in a task varies gradually in a continuous fashion. In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50 ms with a standard deviation of say 30 ms. In this case, some individuals will have greater effects than 50 ms, some will have smaller, and some are forecasted to have negative effects in sign\textemdash they respond faster to incongruent items than to congruent ones! But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are quite alike\textemdash for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively. We also show a case that under very specific circumstances, we could entice some people to not Stroop at all.},

  abstract = {Brain activity can be monitored non-invasively by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which has several advantages in comparison with other imaging methods, such as flexibility, portability, low cost and biochemical specificity. Moreover, patients and children can be repetitively examined. Therefore, the objective of the study was to test the feasibility of NIRS for the event-related approach in functional brain activation studies with cognitive paradigms. Thus, changes in the concentration of oxy-, deoxy-, and total hemoglobin were measured by NIRS in 14 healthy subjects while performing a color\textendash word matching Stroop task in an event-related design. The hemodynamic response (increase in the concentration of oxy-/total hemoglobin and decrease in the concentration of deoxy-hemoglobin) was stronger during incongruent compared to congruent and neutral trials of the Stroop task in the lateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. This stronger hemodynamic response was interpreted as a stronger brain activation during incongruent trials of the Stroop task, due to interference. A new method for NIRS data evaluation that enables the analysis of the hemodynamic response to each single trial is introduced. Each hemodynamic response was characterized by the parameters gain, lag and dispersion of a Gaussian function fitted by nonlinear regression. Specific differences between the incongruent and neutral condition were found for gain and lag. Further, these parameters were correlated with the behavioral performance. In conclusion, brain activity may be studied by NIRS using cognitive stimuli in an event-related design. Hum. Brain Mapping 17:61\textendash 71, 2002. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Cognitive inhibition is a key mechanism in the regulation of emotion. There is emerging evidence that depression is characterized by deficits in the inhibition of mood-congruent material. These deficits could result in prolonged processing of negative, goal-irrelevant aspects of presented information thereby hindering recovery from negative mood and leading to the sustained negative affect that characterizes depressive episodes. Indeed, it has been suggested that deficits in cognitive inhibition lie at the heart of memory and attention biases in depression, and set the stage for ruminative responses to negative events and negative mood states. A ruminative response style results in a heightened vulnerability to experience episodes of major depression. Recent research has demonstrated that deficient inhibition of negative material is associated with heightened rumination. In this article, we review the depression literature with a focus on studies that investigate cognitive inhibition in depressed participants and in participants who report a history of major depressive episodes. In addition, we summarize neurobiological findings that indicate a strong relation between depression and deficits in inhibition and we take a closer look at the relation of inhibition, rumination and mood regulation.},

Confirmatory factor analyses support the concept of a general WMC factor. Results from structural-equation modeling show negligible relations of WMC with response-conflict resolution, and very strong relations of WMC with secondary memory and fluid intelligence.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between IT and the performance and oculomotor variables measured during three simple visual tasks. Participants' ITs were first measured using a slight variation of the standard IT task, which was followed by the three simple visual tasks that were designed to test participants' visual\textendash attentional control and visual working memory under varying degrees of difficulty; they included a visual search task, a comparative visual search task, and a visual memorization task. Significant correlations were found between IT and performance variables for each of the visual tasks. The implications of the correlation between IT and performance-related variables are discussed. Oculomotor variables on the other hand only correlated significantly with IT during the retrieval phase of the visual memorization task, which is likely a product of differences in participants' ability to memorize objects during the loading phase of the experiment. This leads us to the conclusion that the oculomotor variables we measured do not correlate with IT in general, but may in the case where a systematic benefit would be realized.},

  abstract = {Attentional control as an ability to regulate information processing during goal-directed behavior is critical to many theories of human cognition and thought to predict a large range of everyday behaviors. However, in recent years, failures to reliably assess individual differences in attentional control have sparked a debate concerning whether attentional control, as currently conceptualized and assessed, can be regarded as a valid psychometric construct. In this consensus paper, we summarize the current debate from theoretical, methodological, and analytical perspectives. First, we propose a consensus-based definition of attentional control and the cognitive mechanisms that potentially contribute to individual differences in attentional control. Next, guided by the findings of an in-depth literature survey, we discuss the psychometric considerations that are critical when assessing attentional control. We then provide suggestions for recent methodological and analytical approaches that can alleviate the most common concerns. We conclude that, to truly advance our understanding of the construct of attentional control, we must develop a theory-driven and empirically supported consensus on how we define, operationalize, and assess attentional control. This consensus paper presents a first step to achieve this goal; a shift toward transparent reporting, sharing of materials and data, and cross-laboratory efforts will further accelerate progress.},
